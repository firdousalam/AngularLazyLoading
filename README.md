#Lazy-loading feature modules
By default, NgModules are eagerly loaded. This means that as soon as the application loads, so do all the NgModules, whether they are immediately necessary or not. For large applications with lots of routes, consider lazy loading â€”a design pattern that loads NgModules as needed. Lazy loading helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller, which in turn helps decrease load times.

For the final sample application with two lazy-loaded modules that this page describes, see the live example / download example.


#Lazy loading basics
This section introduces the basic procedure for configuring a lazy-loaded route. For a step-by-step example, see the step-by-step setup section on this page.

To lazy load Angular modules, use loadChildren (instead of component) in your AppRoutingModule routes configuration as follows.

AppRoutingModule (excerpt)
content_copy
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'items',
    loadChildren: () => import('./items/items.module').then(m => m.ItemsModule)
  }
];
In the lazy-loaded module's routing module, add a route for the component.

Routing module for lazy loaded module (excerpt)
content_copy
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: ItemsComponent
  }
];
Also be sure to remove the ItemsModule from the AppModule. For step-by-step instructions on lazy loading modules, continue with the following sections of this page.


#Step-by-step setup
Setting up a lazy-loaded feature module requires two main steps:

Create the feature module with the Angular CLI, using the --route flag.
Configure the routes.
Set up an application
If you don't already have an application, follow the following steps to create one with the Angular CLI. If you already have an application, skip to Configure the routes.

Enter the following command where customer-app is the name of your app:


ng new customer-app --routing
This creates an application called customer-app and the --routing flag generates a file called app-routing.module.ts. This is one of the files you need for setting up lazy loading for your feature module. Navigate into the project by issuing the command cd customer-app.

The --routing option requires Angular CLI version 8.1 or higher. See Keeping Up to Date.

Create a feature module with routing
Next, you need a feature module with a component to route to. To make one, enter the following command in the command line tool, where customers is the name of the feature module. The path for loading the customers feature modules is also customers because it is specified with the --route option:

content_copy
ng generate module customers --route customers --module app.module
This creates a customers directory having the new lazy-loadable feature module CustomersModule defined in the customers.module.ts file and the routing module CustomersRoutingModule defined in the customers-routing.module.ts file. The command automatically declares the CustomersComponent and imports CustomersRoutingModule inside the new feature module.

Because the new module is meant to be lazy-loaded, the command does not add a reference to it in the application's root module file, app.module.ts. Instead, it adds the declared route, customers to the routes array declared in the module provided as the --module option.

src/app/app-routing.module.ts
content_copy
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'customers',
    loadChildren: () => import('./customers/customers.module').then(m => m.CustomersModule)
  }
];
Notice that the lazy-loading syntax uses loadChildren followed by a function that uses the browser's built-in import('...') syntax for dynamic imports. The import path is the relative path to the module.

STRING-BASED LAZY LOADING
In Angular version 8, the string syntax for the loadChildren route specification was deprecated in favor of the import() syntax. You can opt into using string-based lazy loading (loadChildren: './path/to/module#Module') by including the lazy-loaded routes in your tsconfig file, which includes the lazy-loaded files in the compilation.

By default the Angular CLI generates projects with stricter file inclusions intended to be used with the import() syntax.

Add another feature module
Use the same command to create a second lazy-loaded feature module with routing, along with its stub component.

content_copy
ng generate module orders --route orders --module app.module
This creates a new directory called orders containing the OrdersModule and OrdersRoutingModule, along with the new OrdersComponent source files. The orders route, specified with the --route option, is added to the routes array inside the app-routing.module.ts file, using the lazy-loading syntax.

src/app/app-routing.module.ts
content_copy
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'customers',
    loadChildren: () => import('./customers/customers.module').then(m => m.CustomersModule)
  },
  {
    path: 'orders',
    loadChildren: () => import('./orders/orders.module').then(m => m.OrdersModule)
  }
];
Set up the UI
Though you can type the URL into the address bar, a navigation UI is straightforward for the user and more common. Replace the default placeholder markup in app.component.html with a custom nav, so you can navigate to your modules in the browser:

src/app/app.component.html
content_copy
<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>

<button type="button" routerLink="/customers">Customers</button>
<button type="button" routerLink="/orders">Orders</button>
<button type="button" routerLink="">Home</button>

<router-outlet></router-outlet>
To see your application in the browser so far, enter the following command in the command line tool window:

content_copy
ng serve
Then go to localhost:4200 where you should see "customer-app" and three buttons.

three buttons in the browser
These buttons work, because the Angular CLI automatically added the routes to the feature modules to the routes array in app-routing.module.ts.


Imports and route configuration
The Angular CLI automatically added each feature module to the routes map at the application level. Finish this off by adding the default route. In the app-routing.module.ts file, update the routes array with the following:

src/app/app-routing.module.ts
content_copy
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'customers',
    loadChildren: () => import('./customers/customers.module').then(m => m.CustomersModule)
  },
  {
    path: 'orders',
    loadChildren: () => import('./orders/orders.module').then(m => m.OrdersModule)
  },
  {
    path: '',
    redirectTo: '',
    pathMatch: 'full'
  }
];
The first two paths are the routes to the CustomersModule and the OrdersModule. The final entry defines a default route. The empty path matches everything that doesn't match an earlier path.

Inside the feature module
Next, take a look at the customers.module.ts file. If you're using the Angular CLI and following the steps outlined in this page, you don't have to do anything here.

src/app/customers/customers.module.ts
content_copy
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { CustomersRoutingModule } from './customers-routing.module';
import { CustomersComponent } from './customers.component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    CustomersRoutingModule
  ],
  declarations: [CustomersComponent]
})
export class CustomersModule { }
The customers.module.ts file imports the customers-routing.module.ts and customers.component.ts files. CustomersRoutingModule is listed in the @NgModule imports array giving CustomersModule access to its own routing module. CustomersComponent is in the declarations array, which means CustomersComponent belongs to the CustomersModule.

The app-routing.module.ts then imports the feature module, customers.module.ts using JavaScript's dynamic import.

The feature-specific route definition file customers-routing.module.ts imports its own feature component defined in the customers.component.ts file, along with the other JavaScript import statements. It then maps the empty path to the CustomersComponent.

src/app/customers/customers-routing.module.ts
content_copy
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

import { CustomersComponent } from './customers.component';


const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: CustomersComponent
  }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class CustomersRoutingModule { }
The path here is set to an empty string because the path in AppRoutingModule is already set to customers, so this route in the CustomersRoutingModule, is already within the customers context. Every route in this routing module is a child route.

The other feature module's routing module is configured similarly.

src/app/orders/orders-routing.module.ts (excerpt)
content_copy
import { OrdersComponent } from './orders.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: OrdersComponent
  }
];
Verify lazy loading
You can verify that a module is indeed being lazy loaded with the Chrome developer tools. In Chrome, open the developer tools by pressing Cmd+Option+i on a Mac or Ctrl+Shift+j on a PC and go to the Network Tab.

lazy loaded modules diagram
Click on the Orders or Customers button. If you see a chunk appear, everything is wired up properly and the feature module is being lazy loaded. A chunk should appear for Orders and for Customers but only appears once for each.

To see it again, or to test after making changes, click the circle with a line through it in the upper left of the Network Tab:

Then reload with Cmd+r or Ctrl+r, depending on your platform.

forRoot() and forChild()
You might have noticed that the Angular CLI adds RouterModule.forRoot(routes) to the AppRoutingModule imports array. This lets Angular know that the AppRoutingModule is a routing module and forRoot() specifies that this is the root routing module. It configures all the routes you pass to it, gives you access to the router directives, and registers the Router service. Use forRoot() only once in the application, inside the AppRoutingModule.

The Angular CLI also adds RouterModule.forChild(routes) to feature routing modules. This way, Angular knows that the route list is only responsible for providing extra routes and is intended for feature modules. You can use forChild() in multiple modules.

The forRoot() method takes care of the global injector configuration for the Router. The forChild() method has no injector configuration. It uses directives such as RouterOutlet and RouterLink. For more information, see the forRoot() pattern section of the Singleton Services guide.


Preloading
Preloading improves UX by loading parts of your application in the background. You can preload modules or component data.

Preloading modules
Preloading modules improves UX by loading parts of your application in the background. By doing this, users don't have to wait for the elements to download when they activate a route.

To enable preloading of all lazy loaded modules, import the PreloadAllModules token from the Angular router.

AppRoutingModule (excerpt)
content_copy
import { PreloadAllModules } from '@angular/router';
Still in the AppRoutingModule, specify your preloading strategy in forRoot().

AppRoutingModule (excerpt)
content_copy
RouterModule.forRoot(
  appRoutes,
  {
    preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules
  }
)
Preloading component data
To preload component data, use a resolver. Resolvers improve UX by blocking the page load until all necessary data is available to fully display the page.

Resolvers
Create a resolver service. With the Angular CLI, the command to create a service is as follows:

content_copy
ng generate service <service-name>
In the newly created service, implement the Resolve interface provided by the @angular/router package:

Resolver service (excerpt)
content_copy
import { Resolve } from '@angular/router';

â€¦

/* An interface that represents your data model */
export interface Crisis {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

export class CrisisDetailResolverService implements Resolve<Crisis> {
  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<Crisis> {
    // your logic goes here
  }
}
Import this resolver into your module's routing module.

Feature module's routing module (excerpt)
content_copy
import { CrisisDetailResolverService } from './crisis-detail-resolver.service';
Add a resolve object to the component's route configuration.

Feature module's routing module (excerpt)
content_copy
{
  path: '/your-path',
  component: YourComponent,
  resolve: {
    crisis: CrisisDetailResolverService
  }
}
In the component's constructor, inject an instance of the ActivatedRoute class that represents the current route.

Component's constructor (excerpt)
content_copy
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

@Component({ â€¦ })
class YourComponent {
  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}
}
Use the injected instance of the ActivatedRoute class to access data associated with a given route.

Component's ngOnInit lifecycle hook (excerpt)
content_copy
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

@Component({ â€¦ })
class YourComponent {
  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.data
      .subscribe(data => {
        const crisis: Crisis = data.crisis;
        // â€¦
      });
  }
}
For more information with a working example, see the routing tutorial section on preloading.

Troubleshooting lazy-loading modules
A common error when lazy-loading modules is importing common modules in multiple places within an application. Test for this condition by first generating the module using the Angular CLI and including the --route route-name parameter, where route-name is the name of your module. Next, create the module without the --route parameter. If ng generate module with the --route parameter returns an error, but runs correctly without it, you might have imported the same module in multiple places.

Remember, many common Angular modules should be imported at the base of your application.
